 Demo-Food-Ordering-Webpage
 This is a food ordering website. I have used normal CSS HTML and MediaQuery for responsiveness so that it can be opened on PCs, tablets and various types of mobiles.
 I have divided this food ordering website into four categories: Home, Services, Clients & Contact us.
 If you want to clone it, you can do it and I used style.CSS for PC and phone.CSS for responsiveness and I merged both of them into the main HTML.
 Built for seamless user experience across all devices 
 Fully responsive - for mobile, tablet, and desktop 
 Deployed using Netlify - for fast and smooth performance 
 I built this project to enhance my skills in UIUX, Responsiveness, Webdevelopment and webdeployment. 
 Would love to hear your feedback and suggestions!  ❤️❤️
